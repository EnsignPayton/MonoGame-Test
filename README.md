# MonoGame-Test

MonoGame examples and test projects

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2017
* MonoGame 3.6

## Building

Before a game will run, its content must be built. I'll work on getting an automated trigger to build content later, for now it's manual. To compile content, open the `Content/Content.mgcb` file for your current project in the MonoGame Pipeline Tool. If Visual Studio opens this as text on double click, you can choose the pipeline tool from the Open With menu. In the pipeline tool, go to Build->Build or press F6 to build all content.
